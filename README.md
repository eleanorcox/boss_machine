In this project I created a REST API to serve Boss Machine, a management application for evil entrepreneurs. I created routes to manage 'minions' and 'million-dollar ideas', and to handle meetings.

## To Run

Navigate to the root directory and run `npm install` to install project dependencies. Once this has finished run `npm run start` to begin the server. You'll see `Server listening on port 4001` in the terminal. Open `index.html` in a browser to access Boss Machine.

## Testing

To run the testing suite, run `npm run test`. This project is in a completed state and hence all tests pass.
